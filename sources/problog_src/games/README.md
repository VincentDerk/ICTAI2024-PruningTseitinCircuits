# Games

Author: Vincent Derkinderen @DTAI
* `coin_toss.pl` - Regular coin toss
* `biased_coin_toss.pl` - Same as coin_toss.pl but with some probability the coin is biased.
* `card_drawing.pl` - Drawing from a set of 13 cards, without replacement.
* `card_drawing_10.pl` - Drawing from a set of 10 cards, without replacement.
* `card_sequence.pl` - Drawing a sequence of cards, without replacement (purposely suboptimal implementation). - REMOVED because no Tseitin variables
* `triplets-in-six-diced-throw.pl` - Throw a six-faced dice 6 times, and compute some probabilities. - REMOVED because ground heavy task, irrelevant for this paper.
